# EmoFace-Emotions_To_Emoji_Avatars

## Introduction

The "Emo Face" project is an innovative application that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV to capture live camera inputs and pre-recorded videos. The project aims to decode emotions from detected faces and translate them into expressive emoji avatars.

## Features

* **Face Detection:** Utilizes OpenCV to precisely detect and extract faces from live camera inputs or videos.
* **Emotion Recognition:** Employs CNN technology to analyze facial expressions and identify emotions.
* **Emoji Avatar Generation:** Translates recognized emotions into vivid visual avatars representing the detected emotions.
* **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface to display real-time emotion recognition and corresponding avatars.

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the required libraries installed (OpenCV, Keras, TensorFlow, etc.).
3. **Run Application:** Execute the main script to launch the application.
4. **Face Emotion Detection:** Observe the live emotion recognition displayed through the webcam or uploaded videos.
5. **Avatar Presentation:** Witness the generation of expressive emoji avatars corresponding to recognized emotions in real-time.

## Dependencies

* **OpenCV:** Used for face detection and image processing.
* **Keras:** Employed to implement the CNN model for emotion recognition.
* **TensorFlow:** Backend framework utilized by Keras for neural network computations.
